	<h1>Overview</h1>
	
	<h2>Running a search</h2>
	
	<p>
		Tailor allows the user to define a motif, and a list of measures. The
		search and measurement are done simultaneously, and the result is a list
		of protein parts and numbers (measurements). This process is shown
		schematically below, along with a motif and some printed results from a run.

	<p>
		The third essential input to the run is some data to search on. This is
		usually going to be pdb files - either stored locally, or from a public
		data bank. However, it could be data from generated models. 
	</p>
	
	<h2>Defining a Motif</h2>
	
	<p>
		A motif is a description with some conditions attached to it. The search
		engine will find all structure fragments that match both the description
		and the conditions. A graphical representation of a motif is shown below.

	</p>
	
	<p>
		The conditions are the dashed lines and boxes above and below the central
		row. Circled numbers represent residues, while the O/N boxes are peptide 
		links. Dashed arcs represent hydrogen bonds and dashed boxes are torsions.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Interpreting the results</h2>
	
	<p>
		The basic results are a table or list, with a row for each structure 
		fragment found. Each row has the identifier for the structure the fragment
		came from, a simple indication of where it is in the structure, and the list
		of measurements. The output - as seen in the java gui - is below.
	</p>

	</p>
	
	<p>
		The results at the command line are just a table of tab-separated text,
		which can easily be manipulated with text parsing tools like grep, or opened
		in a spreadsheet for further analysis.
