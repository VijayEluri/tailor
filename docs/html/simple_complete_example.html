<h1>Simple Complete Example</h1>
	
	A complete java program, using the api, is shown below.
	
	<pre><div class="code">
    
    import tailor.description.DescriptionFactory;
    import tailor.engine.BasicEngine;
    import tailor.engine.Engine;
    import tailor.engine.Run;

    public class SimpleExample {

        public static void main(String[] args) {

            String path = args[0];
        
            DescriptionFactory factory = new DescriptionFactory();
            factory.addResidues(4);
            factory.addHBondCondition(3.5, 90.0, 90.0, 3, 0);
        
            Run run = new Run(path);
            run.addMeasure(factory.createPhiMeasure("psi2", 2));
            run.addMeasure(factory.createPsiMeasure("phi2", 2));
        
            run.addDescription(factory.getProduct());
        
            Engine engine = new BasicEngine();
            engine.run(run);
        }

    }

	<p>
		This code is making a very simple 4-residue description, with the condition
		that it have a backbone hydrogen bond from the CO of residue i + 4 to the 
		NH of residue i. It then sets two torsion measures - phi and psi of residue
		2 and runs against the file(s) represented by <tt>path</tt>.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Most of these calls are to convenience methods, especially those to the
		DescriptionFactory. For more complex descriptions, the relevant objects can
		be created directly. Or, for more advanced use, entirely new measures can be
		defined as classes that implement the <tt>Measure</tt> interface.
