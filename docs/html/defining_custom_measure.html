	<h1>Defining a custom measure</h1>
	
	<h2>The <tt>Measure</tt> base class</h2>
	
	<p>
		The abstract class <tt>Measure</tt> defines one abstract method that any
		derived class must implement:
	</p>
	
	<p><div class="code">
		public abstract Measurement measure(Structure structure) 
		throws DescriptionException;</div>
	</p>
	
	<p>
		However, this is not especially helpful as a guide for implementing the method
		itself. It might be more helpful to look at one of the basic classes provided
		with Tailor : the <tt>DistanceMeasure</tt>.
	</p>
	
	<h2>The <tt>DistanceMeasure</tt> class</h2>
	
	<p>
		This class simply measures the distance between two atoms. This is actually
		done in the <tt>measure</tt> method of the class, as seen below.
	</p>
	
	<div class="code">
	<pre>
    public Measurement measure(Structure structure) 
   	                                  throws DescriptionException {
        Vector a = this.descriptionA.findStructureCenter(structure);
        Vector b = this.descriptionB.findStructureCenter(structure);
        
        double distance = Geometry.distance(a, b);
        return new Measurement(this.getName(), new Double(distance));
    }
    </pre>
    </div>
	
	<p>
		The class holds a pair of <tt>Description</tt> references - <tt>descriptionA
		</tt> and <tt>descriptionB</tt> - that it uses to find points. These points
		(actually, <tt>Vector</tt> objects) are passed to a standard distance method.
		Finally, the result is wrapped in an instance of a <tt>Measurement</tt>.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Parameters for the <tt>measure</tt> method</h2>
	
	<p>
		The <tt>structure</tt> parameter passed to the <tt>measure</tt> method is a
		fragment found by the search for the motif. Any descriptions used by the
		measure must therefore be able to be found within such a fragment. If there
		is some problem finding it, the method can throw a
		<tt>DescriptionException</tt>.
	</p>
