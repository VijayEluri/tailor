        <h1>Getting Started</h1>
        
        <p>
           These are some example steps to show how to use the Tailor GUI. Menu commands are
           formatted like this : <b>Menu->MenuItem</b>.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Setup and Startup</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>Put tailor.jar into a directory, without unpacking it.</li>
			<li>Optionally, make a data subdirectory called "structures", or a softlink to 
			an existing directory of pdb files.</li>
			<li>Run by double clicking on tailor.jar or with "tailor.bat" or "tailor.sh" or "java -jar tailor.jar"</li>
			<li>If you want to use JMol, alter the .sh or .bat file to set the path to 
			the JMol.jar</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Step 1 : Load or Create a Description</h2>
        
        <p>
           The first step is to get a description (a motif or pattern).
           One way is to select the menu option <b>File->Open</b> to open an xml description. 
           Another is to select <b>File->New</b> to create a description from scratch.
        </p>
        
        <p align="center"><img src="../img/file_menu_new.png"/></p>
        
        <p>
           The new description will be displayed as a simplified cartoon in top left. This
           area starts out labelled as "No Motif Loaded". It will revert to this state if
           <b>File->Close</b> is selected. 'Close' will also clear the other parts of the 
           frame.
        </p>
           
        <p align="center"><img src="../img/no_motif_to_some_motif.png"/></p>
        
        <p>
           The name of the motif is shown in the upper left of the panel. No other parts are
           labelled as the font size can get too small to read.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Step 2 : Add Measures to the Description</h2>
        
        <p>
            The description can be edited by double clicking on the image or selecting 
            <b>Edit->Edit Description</b>. This brings up the DescriptionEditor.
        </p>
        
        <p align="center"><img src="../img/description_editor.png"/></p>
        
        <p>
           This is a complex dialog, but for now, just add a measure on phi and psi for 
           the third residue. The circles represent residues (CA atoms), while the N and O are
           the peptide links. To make a phi measure, click on "Add Phi Measure" at the top 
           right, and click on the third circle.
        </p>
        
         <p align="center"><img src="../img/select_phi.png"/></p>
         
         <p>
            The measure is shown as a dashed box below the residue. The question mark 
            indicates that it is a measure and not a condition. Do the same for a psi measure
            on the same residue, and a similar dashed box should appear. Select "Okay".
         </p>   
        
        <h2>Step 3 : Run the Description Against the Sample Data</h2>
        
        <p>
           Now that the description has some measures to be made, it can be run against the
           sample data provided. Select <b>Run->Run</b> or use the command-R shortcut. A 
           progress bar will appear, and the table will start to fill with results.
        </p>
        
        <p align="center"><img src="../img/running.png"/></p>
        
        <p>
           Each measure produces measurements in a separate column, after the column for the
           pdbid and the column for the motif details. 
        </p>
        
        <h2>Step 4 : Select Torsion Columns to Plot</h2>
        
        <p>
           Now that some results are available, it is possible to do some analysis. Tailor is
           not intended for complex numerical analysis, but basic plotting is available. With
           the Ramachandran plot enabled, select two columns that hold torsion data.
        </p>
        
        <p align="center"><img src="../img/rama.png"/></p>
        
        <p>
           The points are plotted in blue on the Ramachandran plot. Additional pairs of columns
           will show as other colours, according to the key on the right hand side of the plot.
        </p>
        
        <h2>(Step 5 : Switch to JMol Panel and Select Row)</h2>
        
        <p>NOTE : This is only available if the path to jmol has been set right!</p>
        
        <p>
           If there is a "JMol" button next to the "Rama" button, then it is possible to see 
           the fragments found by the search, and to show the measurements made. As with the
           Ramachandran plot, clicking on the result table will show on the JMol panel - except
           that only rows can be selected.
        </p>
