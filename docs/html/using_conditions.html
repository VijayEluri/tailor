	<h1>Using Conditions</h1>
	
	<p>
		A condition could also be called a constraint - it is a general way to 
		make the description more specific. They are also closely related to measures
		since a condition has to make a measurement in order to check if it is valid.
	</p>
	
	<p>That is all quite abstract, so here is a concrete example:</p>
	
	<div class="code"><pre>
    Description a = ...
    Description b = ...
    DistanceBoundCondition distance = 
         new DistanceBoundCondition("dON", a, b, 3.0, 1.0);
    chain.addCondition(distance); 
	</pre></div>
	
	<p>
		The two <tt>Description</tt> instances (a and b) at the beginning are just
		descriptions of atoms in a motif. These are passed to the condition, along
		with two geometric parameters : the center of the bound (3.0) and the range
		(1.0). This condition therefore applies to certain atoms within 2-4&Aring;
		of each other.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		It can be easier for some conditions to use the convenience methods in the
		<tt>DescriptionFactory</tt> class. These will find the right atom descriptions
		in the current description and will also add the resulting condition to the 
		right part of the description.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		So, for example, to easily add a TorsionBound on phi and psi to a particular
		residue:
	</p>
	
	<div class="code"><pre>
    DescriptionFactory factory = ...
    factory.createPhiCondition(-90.0, 30.0, 2);
    factory.createPsiCondition(  0.0, 30.0, 2);
	</pre></div>
	
	<p>
		Now, the description will only match fragments where the second residue has
		a &gamma;<sub>R</sub> conformation. A complete list of the convenience
		methods available is in the <a href="function_reference.html">
		function_reference</a>.
	</p>
