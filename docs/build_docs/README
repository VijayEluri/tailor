Now that Tailor has been unpacked there are several ways to use it:

    1) From this directory, using the files in the Tailor directory below.
    2) Install it using setup.py, as normal.
    3) Simply copy the contents of the Tailor subdirectory to the site-package directory of your python installation.

The are also a couple of different ways to interact with the code, as seen in the examples subdirectory:

    1) As a library (see nestmeasure.py in the examples).
    2) Using a script (see nestmeasure.scr in the scripts).

To invoke the python program example (nestmeasure.py) run it like this from this directory:

    python examples/nestmeasure.py <pdbfile_or_directory>

where the item in <> is a path to a pdbfile (.pdb/.ent) or a directory of such files.

To run the script example (nestmeasure.scr) invoke it like this from this directory:

    python Tailor/Script.py scripts/nestmeasure.scr

BUT FIRST! change the value of the filepath and filenames in the script to something that works on your system.
